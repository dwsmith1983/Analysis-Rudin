Prove that there is no rational \(p\) such that \(p^2 = 2\).
\par\smallskip
Suppose \(p\) is rational. Then \(p = m/n\) where \(m, n\in\mathbb{Z}\) such that both \(m\) and \(n\) are not even.
\begin{alignat}{3}
	p^2 &= \frac{m^2}{n^2} &&= 2\notag\\
	&= m^2 &&= 2n^2 \label{eq:1.1}
\end{alignat}
Therefore, since \(m^2 = 2n^2\), \(m^2\) is even and \(m\) is even. Since \(m\) is even, we can write \(m = 2a\) so
\(m^2 = 4a^2\) and \(m^2\) is divisible by \(4\). Now that the left hand side of \cref{eq:1.1} is divisible by 
\(4\) so is the right hand side. Thus, we have reached a contradiction since this would imply both \(m\) and \(n\) 
are even.
