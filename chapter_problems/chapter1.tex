Prove that there is no rational \(p\) such that \(p^2 = 2\).
\par\smallskip
Suppose \(p\) is rational. Then \(p = m/n\) where \(m, n\in\mathbb{Z}\) such that both \(m\) and \(n\) are not even.
\begin{alignat}{3}
	p^2 &= \frac{m^2}{n^2} &&= 2\notag\\
	&= m^2 &&= 2n^2 \label{eq:1.1}
\end{alignat}
Therefore, since \(m^2 = 2n^2\), \(m^2\) is even and \(m\) is even. Since \(m\) is even, we can write \(m = 2a\) so
\(m^2 = 4a^2\) and \(m^2\) is divisible by \(4\). Now that the left hand side of \cref{eq:1.1} is divisible by 
\(4\) so is the right hand side. Thus, we have reached a contradiction since this would imply both \(m\) and \(n\) 
are even.
\par\smallskip
Another common way to prove this is to use the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.
\begin{Theorems}{Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic}{}
	Also known as the Unique Prime Factorization Theorem states that for every \(z\in\mathbb{Z}^+\) either is prime
	or can be expressed as the product of prime numbers and that this representation is unique up to the order of
	the factors.
\end{Theorems}
\noindent
Again, suppose \(p = m / n\) where \(m, n\in\mathbb{Z}\) are co-prime. From \cref{eq:1.1}, we have
\[
	2n^2 = m^2.
\]
By the FTA, both \(n\) and \(m\) can be expressed as unique product of prime factors. Let \(p_i\) be the ith prime 
for \(n\) and \(q_i\) be the ith prime for \(b\) where \(\alpha_i\) is ith power of \(n\) and \(\beta_i\) is the ith power 
\(m\). Then
\begin{align}
	n^2 &= p_1^{2\alpha_1}\cdot  p_2^{2\alpha_2}\cdots  p_k^{2\alpha_k}\notag\\
	m^2 &= q_1^{2\beta_1}\cdot  q_2^{2\beta_2}\cdots  q_l^{2\beta_l}\notag
\end{align}
Let \(p_j\) and \(q_j\) be the representation of prime factorization of \(2\). Then we have
\begin{alignat}{2}
	2\cdot 2^{2\alpha_j} &= 2^{2\beta_j}\notag\\
	2^{2\alpha_j + 1} &= 2^{2\beta_j}\label{eq:1.2}
\end{alignat}
From \cref{eq:1.2}, we have \(2\alpha_j + 1\) must equal \(2\beta_j\) but this cannot be the case since 
\(2\alpha_j + 1\) is clearly odd and \(2\beta_j\) is even. Thus, we have reached a contradiction and \(p\) is irrational.
